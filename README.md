# Code for paper titled "Development of synthetic chloride transporters using high-throughput screening and machine learning"

To begin reproducing the results from the paper, users will need to download the ZIP file as shown below, unzip the work files, and follow the instructions on the Chloride Transport - Modeling Guide PDF file to set up the environment and environement variable for running the modeling code. Users can then build the models and get predictions by running the run_auto_qsar.ipynb notebook.
