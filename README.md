## Code for paper titled "Development of synthetic chloride transporters using high-throughput screening and machine learning"

To begin reproducing the results from the paper, users will need to follow the instructions on the "Chloride Transport - Modeling Guide.pdf" file to set up the environment and environement variable for running the modeling code. Users can then build the models and get predictions by running the run_auto_qsar.ipynb notebook.
